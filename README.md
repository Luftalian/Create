# Rocket Making!!!!!!

For making Create's Board

Create is the club in Tokyo Institute of Technology.
We make rockets!!!

My last goal of this repository is to make a board which can measure two types of acceleraion (16g & 400g), gyroscope, barometric pressure, and magnetometation.

I made Library of H3LIS331.
This is an accelerometer which can measure +-400g.

I also made Library of S25FL512S.
This is a SPI Flash which can record 512Mbite.

Also I will make Board for logging data.
Our team will log data of two accelerometer & angular velocity & LPS25 which is barometric pressure sensor.
