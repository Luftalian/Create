# Rocket Making!!!!!!

For making Create's Board

Create is the club in Tokyo Institute of Technology.
We make rockets!!!

My last goal of this repository is to make a board which can measure two types of acceleraion (16g & 400g), gyroscope, barometric pressure, and magnetometation in **1000Hz**.

I made Library of H3LIS331.
This is an accelerometer which can measure +-400g.

I also made Library of S25FL512S.
This is a SPI Flash which can record 512Mbite.

Also I will make Board for logging data.
Our team will log data of two accelerometer & angular velocity & LPS25 which is barometric pressure sensor.

# About branch

"main" is not main branch.
"betabeta" is main branch.

# directory

`Log_Board_practice_v1.0.0` latest version.
This can measure two types of acceleraion (16g & 400g), gyroscope, barometric pressure, and magnetometation in **1000Hz**.

`Log_Board_v4.0.0`
This is version which use for production environment.
This is able to contact with other board.
